# RDF4J Vue Components

(c) Radek Burget 2025

A library of vue.js components for interacting with the RDF4J API. It includes an API client,
query editor, query result display components and some more auxiliary components. These components
are used in several projects such as [rdf4j-vue](https://github.com/radkovo/rdf4j-vue)
or [FitLayout PageView](https://github.com/FitLayout/PageView).
